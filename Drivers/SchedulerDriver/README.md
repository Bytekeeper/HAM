# SchedulerDriver

This driver can be used to schedule events like
- turn on lights in sleeping room every morning at 06:00
- set light color to red every evening at 23:00

Additionally, a CalDav calendar (e.g. from OwnCloud) can be queried for event triggering, allowing complex scenarios like 
- turn on lights in sleeping room every morning, except on holidays
